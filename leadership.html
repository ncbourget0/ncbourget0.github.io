      <h1 id="fall24">Fall 2024</h1>
      <p>Fall 2024 is our latest and likely most difficult semester at the Garment Printing Club. Nothing great is without failure, even later in its lifetime. As I now have moved to Allston and have no means of returning to the Artist Resdience workroom, the club has returned to the Veteran's lounge. There are many problems with this space, both in and out of my control. As I am the only authority at the GPC, and our userbase has grown tenfold, I cannot watch what everyone is doing all at once. The Veteran's lounge houses the materials of every club at MassArt. Somethings were tampered with behind my back, some ink was spilled on the carpet, there isn't a ton that can be done about that besides stern words and announcements. Despite this challenge at the beginning of the semester, the club had begun to fall into a brand new groove with the small space. Everyone learned the ways of being respectful in the lounge and our membership grew easily to 50 members per meeting. I was still the only true teacher at the GPC however I found three people who have shown a strong interest in the club that I consider to be my successors. With many people now skillsharing, the club was function at high speed and now devoid of controversy. We will continue next semester.</p>

      <h1 id="award">Awards and Nominations</h1>
      <p>The Garment Printing Club had an excellent year working in Artist Residence. Eveyone got their prints, we had many collaborations with other clubs, we had taught a 2-day silkscreen workshop in the Arnheim gallery with Iz, I had created the graphic and all of the shirts for the statehouse visit, and we had an awesome gallery ourselves. I personally was nominated for three seprate SGA awards: Unsung Hero, Emerging Leader, and the Leader of the Year award. The club itself was nominated and recieved the Student Organization of the Year Award! Everyone in the club who was free the next day came and took a group photo. Our hard work had paid off.</p>

    <p>Heily Rivas, the president of SGA at the time, came to me and asked if I would be interested in creating a graphic for MassArt's statehouse visit. The intent of the visit was to request funding for the deteriorating tower building. I of course was ecstatic that I could be a part of something greater through means of the club and so I agreed and began working on two different graphics. The taller graphic was chosen and about 30 shirts were printed. I am told that someone very important at the statehouse now has my work hung up in their office because of this visit.</p>

      <h1 id="tltyf">The Last Thing you Forget</h1>
      <p>The Last Thing you Forget was another gallery that my good friend Iz Hall had organized with two of her friends. She is an aspiring art teacher herself and centered the gallery around workshops for gallerygoers to parttake in. There was a zine making workshop, blockprinting workshop, and some sculpture workshops. During the gallery, for two days, Iz invited the GPC to teach basic screenprinting. I had an elite idea for this in order to have everyone get what they wanted - I was to expose a gigantic screen with 50 tiny graphics on it that people could pull, cut into patches, and just take the patches that they wanted. And as the zine workshop fell inbetween our workshops, a lot of the drawings from the zine were put on another patch screen! This event was truly incredible for community building. I want to thank Iz for making this semester really something special for the GPC and its communtiy.</p>

      <h1 id="themessage">The Message</h1>
      <p>The Message was a gallery I had curated for the club. I worked on all of the art direction over the Summer before the Spring 2024 semester. I was really into the book The White Album by Joan Didion aswell as Slouching Towards Bethlehem. I read a little of Hell's Angels by Hunter S. Thompson but didn't get too far. I had been seeing all of these hand printed shirts online from the 1960's and while reading these books I had a bit of a phase. I knew how tragically annoying people can be today about "hippie culture" and things being "trippy and groovy" but I felt I was self aware enough to hurdle above these era stereotypes. I let the club know that we were set to have a gallery showing, gave them many links to movies to watch, articles and books to read, even an entire moodboard setup. I let everyone know that if they didn't want to make a 60's homemade feeling shirt, but they were still passionate, we could talk about it. The gallery installation went up without a cinch. We even got a mannequin! People I had never seen before spent a lot of time in the gallery as we set up just to stare at the different shirts we had hung up. I'm certain there is an added interest in many, many people when they walk into a gallery setting to see some piece of refined art that they actually could picture on their on body.</p>

      <p>Spring was the last time that we would be staying in the dorms. Everyone in the club knew this as questions had begun to fly if the club was going to continue into the following semester. I was completey unsure what to make of this and I had no idea how difficult it was going to be running the club from an entirely different neighborhood. The ease with running the GPC came from having everything I needed in arm's reach. The workroom and my living space resided in the same building, so there was never any problem. Now that I was going to live in Allston anything could happen. We forged ahead though, thinking about details later. I feel like I always had it in my heart, I knew the GPC would continue on. During this semester we ran our first club gallery, "The Message", a gallery that I cooridnated all the curating and art direction for. I was personally asked to print shirts for the MassArt statehouse visit to </p>

      <p>As my friends and I all moved into the next dorm, Artist Residence at MassArt, we took the entire club with us. Especially at the time, the printing press was a personal object I had lugged from my home in Westford to the dorms. It was a massive object and the school hadn't funded one for us yet. For this semester, the club went rather normally, there was much more of an emphasis on creating a large amount of shirts to give to friends and family. There was also much more of a focus on creating screens by hand to cut any costs associated. The club had officially moved to the 7th floor workroom of Artist Residence and stayed there even over winter break.</p>

      <p>Power in the GPC had begun to set in, we realized the Veteran's lounge in the Kennedy building would not cut it anymore. There was too high a likelyhood of us spilling ink on the floor or damaging other people's materials. As the president and founder, I could not let this risk go without growing a few grey hairs. Instead, we moved our club to the 19th floor of the Treehouse building. This was a workroom that was occupied by my friends and I almost exclusively. It was a fantastic place where art breathed deeply. Our prints became much more in-depth and sophisticated as our concurrent membership grew in stride.</p>

      <p>This was the beginning for the Garment Printing Club (GPC). We began in the Veteran's lounge spending hours drawing on acetate. At the time, I only wanted to create the club for means of acquiring a budget from the school for printing. As I am not a printmaking major here at MassArt, I have no other means of acquiring printmaking materials through the school I pay to go to. Pretty soon, people I had never met started to enter the club, the height of one of our early meetings was about 15 people. I learned quickly that I would need to use an exposure unit outside of class during the week to prep everyone's designs before Wednesday night or else the club would not run. What quickly transpired was the change from my plan to get screenprinting equipment into my lifetime love of teaching silkscreen. The hundreds of smiling faces looking at me when we pull the screen off the shirt to see a pixel-to-pixel perfect print is worth more than any school club budget.<br><br> Here are a few of the acetate sheets from these embryonic meetings.</p>
